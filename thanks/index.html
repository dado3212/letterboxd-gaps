    <h1>Thanks</h1>
    This website relies on a lot of data, APIs, public libraries, and other repositories.
    There is no formal affiliation between this website and any of these or their creators, but wanted
    to say thanks.
    <h2>Letterboxd</h2>
    <p>
      All fonts, colors, and poster images are theirs. Any data mistakes are my own.
      For rendering the map for the country view I use their version of <code>svgMap.min.js</code>, which
      in turn is a modified version of StephanWagner's svgMap (see LICENSES).
      <br /><br />
      Also just a huge thanks to them for making such a great website and community, I've discovered and enjoyed
      so many gems that I wouldn't have without its existence.
    </p>

    <h2>TMDb</h2>
    <p>
      Letterboxd uses The Movie Database (TMDb), and I also use it for fetching country, language, and female director information.
      See Letterboxd's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/about/film-data/">page</a> for full information.<br />
      This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.<br /><br />

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://jamesbvaughan.com/movie-director-genders/">https://jamesbvaughan.com/movie-director-genders/</a> - An analysis that James did on his own data (Ruby) that prompted me to make this in PHP</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GoodbyteCo/Directed-By-Women">https://github.com/GoodbyteCo/Directed-By-Women</a> - A broken website that tried to do just the "directed by women" section</li>
        <li><a href="https://colorboxd.com/">https://colorboxd.com/</a> - A (currently) broken website for color sorting lists that sparked my curiosity in color sorting (though most of that code hasn't yet landed in this repo)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTD0u-O1uvM&t=57m14s">Kirsten Dunst's pitch for actresses to work with female directors</a> - "It's up to us as actresses to give the opportunity to first time directors. Most of those people it was their first time."
          Being more thoughtful about watching and highlighting movies by female directors is a tiny contribution, but one that I wanted to be more conscious about.
